#You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second occurrence of the second string in the first one.
#Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims".
# Itâ€™s easy to find its first occurrence with a function index or find which will point out that "s" is the 
# first symbol in a word "sims" and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0. But we have to find the 
# second "s" which is 4th in a row and that means that the index of the second occurrence 
# (and the answer to a question) is 3.
