#In this mission your task is to determine the popularity of certain words in the text.
#At the input of your function are given 2 arguments: the text and the array of words the 
#popularity of which you need to determine.
#When solving this task pay attention to the following points:
#The words should be sought in all registers. This means that if you need to find a word 
#"one" then words like "one", "One", "oNe", "ONE" etc. will do.
#The search words are always indicated in the lowercase.
#If the word wasnâ€™t found even once, it has to be returned in the dictionary with 0 (zero) value.
